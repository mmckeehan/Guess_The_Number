# Guess_The_Number

This is a simple "Guess the number" game that I created. It will allow a person to select the dificulty of the game they play, giving them the a different number range and number of guesses. 

In this I used C# to create the console app and set up methods to control both the difficulty setting and the core gameplay loop.
